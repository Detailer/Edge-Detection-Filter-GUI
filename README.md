# Edge Detection Filter GUI
Edge Detection Filter GUI using Java

We decided to build a GUI application that implements various edge detection algorithms to image files. The application previews both the incoming image stream and displays the computed result with the detected edges.Edge Detection Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness. Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.

Filters Used in The Project: 
- Horizontal & Vertical Filters
- Sobel Horizontal & Vertical Filters
- Scharr Horizontal & Vertical Filters
- Canny Edge Detection Algorithm

The project was completed while keeping one goal in mid, to gain hands-on
knowledge of the topics covered in class lectures. We aimed to include most of the
topics covered in labs and classes to gain a clear understanding of the Java
Language.
